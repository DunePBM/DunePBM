# RULES FOR DunePBM #

This game will be 10 turns. This game will use Double Spice Blow and Advanced Combat. This game will use the WBC rules, except where noted in this document.

We will be using the WBC rules clarifications (http://www.boardgamers.org/yearbkex/dunpge.htm), where applicable.

We are playing all of the Basic rules, all of the Optional rules except Rule XVIII.A (Longer Game), and all of the Advanced rules. All rules are published in the Avalon Hill 1979 edition of the game, except for Rule XVIII.B (Shild Wall Stronghold) for which a varation will be used (see below).

We are NOT using any of the additions introduced in any official or unofficial expansions (The Duel, Spice Harvest, articles from The General, or anything else). The Eurogames/Descartes edition of the game includes some of these elements as standard play, so make sure you understand which parts will not be used: So, no 10-point leaders, no kanly or duels, no spice harvest rounds or variable setup, and no non-standard factions. The factions used are limited to Atreides, Bene Gesserit, Emperor, Fremen, Guild, and Harkonnen.

We will be using the standard card set: 4 x Projectile Weapons, 4 x Poison Weapons, 4 x Shields, 4 x Snoopers, 1 x Lasegun, 3 x Cheap Hero(ine)s, 5 x Worthless Cards, 1 x Hajr, 1 x Tleilaxu Ghola, 1 x Weather Control, 1 x Family Atomics, 2 x Truthtrances, and 2 x Karamas.


## HOUSE RULES ##

We are using the following house rules:

1. Alliances may consist of up to 2 factions.

2. An unallied faction must control 3 strongholds to win. Two-faction alliances must control 4 strongholds to win.

3. The Shield Wall is considered to be a stronghold for the purposes of victory ONLY, immediately after the 6th worm appears (counting all worms, even Karama worms summoned by the Fremen). Victory conditions are unchanged after the Shield Wall becomes a stronghold, meaning it should become a bit easier to win after that point.

~ Shipment to the Shield Wall still costs 2 spice/token (1 spice/token for Guild shipment), as usual for rock spaces.

~ Occupation of the Shield Wall is not restricted to only 2 factions, as usual for rock spaces.

~ The Shield Wall is not affected by storm or worm, as usual for both strongholds and rock spaces.

~ Family Atomics may be used as written. When Family Atomics is played, all tokens on the Shield Wall are destroyed (regardless of storm location), but the Shield Wall continues to be treated as a stronghold and continues to be unaffected by storm or worm.

~ In the unlikely event that two separate factions occupy the Shield Wall at the end of a turn (due to location of the storm preventing battle between them), neither faction is considered to control that stronghold for the purposes of victory determination.

~ In the event that two factions can win the game (which can happen once the Shield Wall is a stronghold), then the winning faction without the Sheld Wall is the true winner.

4. Spice may only be transferred from one player to another during the Collection Round of each turn. Deals involving the transfer of spice may be made at any time, but the transfer may only be performed during a future Collection Round, even between allies. The Emperor's special alliance ability becomes "You may transfer spice to (NOT from) your allies at any time."

4b. No player shall transfer spice solely to collect CHOAM Charity.

5. The Fremen (and ally) may count their tokens at full strength for no cost in battles.

## PBEM House Rules: ##

6. All players may keep written notes.

7, Any dispute in timing not otherwise clarified will be resolved in posting order.

8. Bidding is done by open auction.

9. Revival and movement orders are given at the same time.

11. No player agreement may prohibit the breakup of an alliance.


# GAME PROCEDURES #

Players may ask for status reports at any time. A status summary will be sent to players after the Collection Round. The map will be updated after the Spice Round.

Time limits: The term "24 hours" means 24 hours to the minute after an action is posted on the board, the time limit to react to that action expires. If, for example, the Atreides posts a shipment of 10 tokens to Tuek’s, and the time stamp on the post reads 5:01 pm on July 24th, then the Guild has until 5:01 pm on the 25th to play a Karama to block it.

Editing posts: Please do not edit or delete your posts. Leave them be as you wrote them. If you need to retract something, then post again.


### To Start Game ###

A. Players can submit faction preferences as they register, in order of preference, up to three factions. Those solely requesting a specific faction will play that faction. Joint requests will be resolved randomly. Players may trade factions if they wish to, and may offer a spice bribe (from their starting spice) when doing so.

B. The Bene Gesserit reports the prediction.

C. GM gives traitor candidates.

D. Players pick their traitor.

E. Fremen select their opening board positions.

F. Bene Gesserit select their opening board position.

G. The GM reports initial treachery cards and the spice blows.


### Storm Round ###

A. GM declares the movement of the storm.

B. Starting turn 2, a player has 24 hours (from the start of the spice round) to play Weather Control.

C. Starting turn 2, a player has 24 hours (from the start or the spice round or from the time Weather Control is played) to play Family Atomics.

D. The GM announces the effects of the storm.


### Spice Round ###

A. The GM reports the cards that will appear from the spice deck.

B. If one of the cards is Shai-Hulud, then Nexus occurs immediately:

B.1. Alliances are binding when all parties to it post their acceptance. Any attached terms must be listed by all parties in their acceptance post or no alliance is formed..

B.2. Worm movement at the end of the nexus must be within 24 hours of the alliances being finalized.

B.3. The GM summaries worm effects.

C. The GM continues to report the remaining cards.

D. GM reports to the Fremen the distance the storm will move next turn.


###Bidding Round###

The GM announces the number of Treachery cards each faction holds.

While the first card is up for bid players my request CHOAM Charity.

The bidding is by open auction; players may place a bid for the card at any time and are not required to bid in order.

Every 24 hours that the game is in session a card will be placed up for bid, and the card bidding process takes 48 hours (two cards will be up for bid at the same time).

For each card up for bid the following will occur:

A. Atreides and other privileged parties will be told the identity of the card when the card is put up for bid. (Any payer may play a Karama card before bidding begins to cancel this effect.)

B. After 24 hours the high-bid will be announced.

C. At any time bidding will close if there has been 24 hours without a new bid. To expedite the game, players not wishing to bid should declare "pass."

D. After 48 hours the open auction has ended. If there is no undisputed winner then faction with the high-bid at the 24 hour mark and any factions that have bid after the high-bid announcement may engage in a sealed bid auction via PM. The opening bid for this auction is one more than the current high bid. The winner of the auction pays the minimum amount required to win. In the event of a tie, a winner will be determined by player order, starting with the faction that was the 24 hour high-bidder.

D.1. Note: If you bid on a card, you are expected to purchase the card if you are able. You may not revoke a bid. If, because of concurrent bidding, you have bid more than you currently have, then your bid on the newest card will be reduced to your current spice holdings. If you are no longer able to claim a card because you have reached the maximum number of cards, your bid on any cards still up for auction will be withdrawn.

E. The winner of the card pays the Emperor. (The winner of the card may play a Karama card to avoid paying.)

F. If the winner of the card is Harkonnen, the player receives an additional card that is unknown to the Atreides. (Any player may play a Karama card to cancel this effect.)


### Revival and Movement ###

A. The GM reveals the top card of the Spice deck to the Atreides. (Any player may play a Karama card to cancel this effect.)

B. The Bene Gesserit declares co-existence.

C. The Guild either declares that:

C.1. Players need not wait to take their turn unless the GM or the Guild asks them to delay their turn so that the Guild may preempt (note that just because a player is asked to delay their turn, does not mean the that guild must preempt at that time); or

C.2. Players must await the Guild’s post stating whether the Guild is or is not preempting before they proceed with their own move.

C.3. (At any time before the Guilds turn in player order, any player may play a Karama card to force the Guild to place their movement orders in player order.)

D. For all players, in player order place their revival and movement orders:

Note: Players must wait for the Bene Gesserit's decision to send an adviser only if occupancy potentially restricts their movement. Otherwise, they may proceed at their own discretion. Movement orders must consist of:

D.1. Revival (regular tokens, starred tokens, leader, spice paid)

D.2. Shipment (destination including sector, spice paid)

D.3. Movement (starting and ending locations including sector, with number of tokens/starred tokens).

D.4. Treachery cards played during movement (Karama or Hajr).

D.5. If a player posts orders that omit revival, shipment, or movement, or make an illegal play, the GM or a player will obtain clarification on the omission before movement proceeds to the next faction.

E. Special actions:

E.1. Bene Gesserit has 24 hours after each shipment to accompany. The next player moving does not have to wait for the BG’s decision before moving, and the BG may accompany within the 24 deadline even if players have moved since. (B.G. may post instructions on accompaniment at the start of the round such as, "I will accompany all shipments to X, Y, Z strongholds" this turn). A player has 24 hours after the B.G. accompanies to play a Karama to block it. They then have the rest of their lives to justify it.

E.1.a. If the Bene Gesserit does not specify whether or not acompanying advisors are are co-existing, then are are assumed to be co-existing.

E.2. The Guild has 24 hours after each shipment to play a Karama to block. Movement automatically reverts back to the faction that was subjected to the Karama even if other factions have moved since; the blocked player has 24 hours from the play of the Guild Karama to alter their on-planet movement, then play proceeds. (It is advised that in situations where it is important, players either ask Guild to clarify whether he is playing a Karama before they proceed with their own move, or that Guild retains the option to preempt for each player in situations where he intends to Karama a movement).

E.3. Another faction must play a Karama to force the Guild to move in order at any point in the movement round prior to turn order passing the Guild player’s dot. The instant that the player after Guild posts a movement order (even if incomplete) it becomes too late to play the Karama.


### Battle Round ###

A. The GM or players summarize the location, factions, and numbers of tokens involved
in each combat.

B. In storm order, the next player must specify the order of resolution of their battles.

C. The Voice is given. If the B.G. may instruct the GM to allow their ally to give the Voice in their behalf, or may retain the right to give the voice directly.

D. A Karama card is played to block the Voice.

E. The Prescience question is given. The Atreides may instruct the GM to allow their ally to give the Prescience question, or may retain the right to give the question directly.

F. The Prescience question is answered or a Karama card is played (whichever happens first).

G. Truthtrance, or Karama played to negate starred tokens, or played by Atreides to view an entire battle plan, or transfer of spice (if possible) may be done at any time prior to Step H below.

G.1. The GM makes a last call for Treachery card plays and spice transfers (if possible). Players will then have 24 hours before Step H to play a Treachery, transfer spice, or pass.

H. The GM calls for players to submit battle plans. (After this point no Treachery plays or spice transfers may occur.):
- Leader identity or Cheap Hero(ine)
- Number dialed
- Support paid
- Weapon or Worthless Card played
- Defense or Worthless Card played
- Kwisatz Haderach (Atreides only)

I. The moment both battle plans have been submitted to the GM is considered to be the moment of revelation of battle plans; no alterations of battle plans by either player are allowed after that point even if there is a delay between submission and posting by the GM of battle results.

J. A player has 24 hours from the posting of the battle results on the thread to call "traitor". The Harkonnen has 24 hours from the same point, if victorious; to announce a leader capture and the decision to send the leader to the tanks. Any Karama played to prevent leader capture must occur within 24 hours of the Harkonnen announcement he is capturing a leader. Any player may delay the next battle until all traitor calls and captures have been made.

K. Factions fighting later in the battle order may resolve their combat without waiting the results from those earlier in battle order if no player objects and there is no potential effect on their battle from the earlier combats.


### Collection Round ###

A. Players summarize their collected and transferred spice to the GM.

B. GM or players report spice collected from spice blows and city income.

C. Spice given during that turn is transferred.

D. GM reports whether or not the game been won and by whom.

E. GM reports faction status individually to each player.


### Miscellaneous ###

A. A player may decide to play treachery cards at any applicable time:

A.1. If the Harkonnen is swapping hands, he declares how many cards he is taking, then the GM reports to the Harkonnen and the victimized faction which cards are drawn, then the Harkonnen informs the GM and victimized faction which cards he will give from his own hand.

A.2. Any player has 24 hours to prevent the B.G. from using a worthless card as a Karama. This act may occasionally cause an auction or movement to restart. The B.G. must always announce the identity of the card played, (Karama, Kulon, La La La, etc.) when using a Karama.

B. Actions take effect the instant they are posted on the thread. Any posted action may be reversed or changed provided that no further game action has occurred.

C. An illegal action will be declared by the GM to have been illegal, and the reason specified. For example, if a player plays a Karama and then quickly retracts the action, but in fact never had a Karama in their possession to begin with, then the GM will state the move was illegal with the reason being the player did not have a Karama card.

D. Players may negotiate on or off the game thread. A deal becomes binding only when all parties to it have posted their acceptance of the terms on the thread. Deals made off-thread are never binding. BE CAREFUL TO CHECK THE TERMS OF ANY AGREEMENT YOU ENTER INTO: the terms are what are posted on the thread, not what you thought the agreement was.

E. The GM will announce the factions and recipient in a spice trade, but will not announce the amount traded.

F. Players can appoint their allies or other stand-ins as caretakers while they are absent. However, any action they take on the player’s behalf is considered official unless it violates an instruction sent to the GM or posted.

G. Truthtrance questions about future intentions are permitted. Players must abide by the answers they have given, if it is possible to do so. Any question asked must be stated in a way that is theoretically possible to express purely in terms of game components (not player intention or action), and must be referenced to one moment in time. After the turn in which the question was asked, Truthtrance answers are no longer binding.

H. Play can continue before a truthtrance is answered, if the giver of the question does not object. The giver of the T/T may thereafter at any time stop play to force the recipient to answer the question as the next game action. The GM will not provide the truthtrance answer; the target will have the opportunity to negotiate in all instances.

I. Players can arrange the outcome of a battle by specifying a "standard" deal: (1) neither player will play a weapon, (2) the player agreeing to lose will dial zero, (3) the players will agree to the leaders being used, (4) neither player will call treachery, (5) Harkonnen will not capture a leader.

J. A public agreement between parties must be honored in full. Anything that would prevent one of the parties involved from honoring an entire agreement in full, voids the agreement.

K. Any alterations or additions to these rules will be made at the end of a Collection Round.
